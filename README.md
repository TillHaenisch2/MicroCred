# MicroCred
Public Material for Micro-credential publications

This repository contains examples that show, how to convert module descriptions to a standard form as described in the paper "".

The first example (Implementation issues of distributed systems) is a very simple example, a technology lab. Here the conversion is pretty straightforward.

The second example (Software engineering) is much more complex: first, it is larger and has to be divided in three parts to be used as a micro-credential. Second most learning outcomes here are less technical, more skill- and communication oriented. To be honest, we couldn't find a more complex example in out CS-curriculum.
